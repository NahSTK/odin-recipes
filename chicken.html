    <h3>Ingredients and Cookware</h3>
    <p>For this recipe you will need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 small chicken legs (per person)</li>
        <li>1 baking dish</li>
        <li>Some sweet smoked paprika</li>
        <li>Some romera</li>
        <li>Some parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <p>Now onto the cooking:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><Strong>Prepare the plate.</Strong> Put a little touch of olive oil like iff you were guided by Gordom Ramsay. This is adviced to avoid the skin sticking to the plate while in the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Under the skin.</strong> Embrace the skin on your chicken by using it to your advantage. Roll it back a bit, season with paprika, romera and a touch of parsley, allowing flavour to sink deep into the fibers.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't forget the outside.</strong> Seasoning the outside of your chicken leg is also a good idea to have a crispy and tasty sking to bite into later.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking.</strong> With a pre-heted oven at low heat, throw the chicken legs inside. Remember you can combine this with 
        <a href="cream_potatoes.html"> this other recipe</a> to make some company for your plate in the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>ENJOY!</strong> Since this meal has a similar baking time you can expect 1 and a half hours before it's ready too. So you can have a good timed side dish to eat with your crispy chicken.</li>
    </ol>
